# Roadmap

This document tracks the publication plan for the `ferro-protocols`
workspace. The full strategy is in `OSS_PUBLICATION_STRATEGY_v2.md`
in the parent project; this is the public-facing summary.

## Tier 1 — first wave

These six crates are the foundation. Each is extracted from a Ferro
ecosystem product where it has working test coverage today. All six
reached their first semver-stable release (`v1.0.0`) on 2026-06-08 —
clippy pedantic + nursery clean under `-D warnings`, `unsafe_code =
forbid`, `cargo audit` / `cargo deny` clean, ≥95% mutation kill rate,
≥85% line coverage, and a 6-round adversarial design-review pass.
`ferro-airflow-dag-parser` subsequently shipped a semver-compatible
security patch (`v1.0.1`, 2026-06-16) closing a parser stack-overflow
DoS; the other five remain at `v1.0.0`.

| Crate | Source product | Current version | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`ferro-blob-store`](../crates/ferro-blob-store/) | FerroRepo storage | `v1.0.0` | stable — foundation content-addressed blob store (in-memory + filesystem) |
| [`ferro-lumberjack`](../crates/ferro-lumberjack/) | FerroBeat / FerroHeartbeat | `v1.0.0` | stable — Lumberjack/Beats v2 codec + client + server, TLS both directions; per-window memory cap |
| [`ferro-airflow-dag-parser`](../crates/ferro-airflow-dag-parser/) | `ferro-air` | `v1.0.1` | stable — static AST DAG extraction (ruff backend), panic-shielded + recursion-DoS hardened |
| [`ferro-maven-layout`](../crates/ferro-maven-layout/) | FerroRepo Maven | `v1.0.0` | stable — Maven layout 2.0 + POM/metadata parsing (panic-shielded); PUT body limit + TOCTOU fix |
| [`ferro-cargo-registry-server`](../crates/ferro-cargo-registry-server/) | FerroRepo Cargo | `v1.0.0` | stable — Cargo Alternative Registry (RFC 2789) server + binary + `/metrics` + K8s probes + durable index; real-`cargo` verified |
| [`ferro-oci-server`](../crates/ferro-oci-server/) | FerroRepo OCI | `v1.0.0` | stable — OCI Distribution v1.1 server + binary + `/metrics` + K8s probes + durable metadata. **Official conformance suite: 75/75 specs pass** (harness in `crates/ferro-oci-server/tests/conformance/`) |

## Tier 2 — secondary wave

Followups extracted as the corresponding Ferro product reaches the
relevant phase:

- `ferro-pep503-pep691` (FerroRepo / PyPI primitives)
- `ferro-go-module-proxy` (FerroRepo)
- `ferro-helm-chart-repo` (FerroRepo)
- `ferro-painless` (FerroStash / Elasticsearch Painless)
- `ferro-esql-parser` (FerroSearch)
- `ferro-eql-parser` (FerroSearch)
- `ferro-aql-parser` (FerroRepo / Artifactory)
- `ferro-logstash-dsl-parser` (Migration Suite)
- `ferro-keycloak-realm-import` (FerroAuth)

## Tier 4 — explicitly out of scope

To avoid duplicating well-maintained upstream crates, the workspace
will not publish:

- A Kafka wire-protocol crate — `kafka-protocol` (tychedelia) covers
  Kafka 4.1+ via codegen.
- A Cassandra CQL driver — `scylla-rust-driver` and `cdrs-tokio` are
  established.
- An MQTT client — `rumqttc` is the mainstream choice.
- A Redis RESP layer — `redis` is dominant.
- An AMQP 1.0 implementation — `fe2o3-amqp` covers it.
- An OCI distribution **client** crate — `oci-client` is sufficient
  (we publish a server-side complement, not a client duplicate).

When we have improvements to any of the above, we send a PR upstream
rather than fork.

## Versioning policy across the workspace

| Stage | Range | Breaking changes | Time in stage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alpha | `v0.0.x` | Allowed at any release | typically 3-6 months from publication |
| Beta | `v0.1.x`–`v0.x.x` | Allowed at minor bumps; deprecation cycle starts | 6-12 months |
| Stable | `v1.x.x` | Strict semver | indefinite |

All six Tier 1 crates reached **Stable (`v1.x`)** on 2026-06-08
(`ferro-airflow-dag-parser` is now at `v1.0.1`). Each crate is versioned
and released independently — there is no single workspace version number,
and the workspace-level `[workspace.package].version` is a non-inherited
baseline default (every member crate pins its own `version`). From each
crate's `v1.0.0` onward its public API is a strict semver contract:
breaking changes (renames, removals, or signature changes that aren't
strict additions) require a major bump; patch/minor releases may add
items and `#[deprecate]` existing ones, but will not remove them.

## What "ready to publish" means here

Before a crate is published to crates.io, it must:

1. Pass `cargo check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
   `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test`, `cargo deny check`,
   `cargo audit` on a clean checkout.
2. Build on the workspace MSRV (currently rustc 1.88 — required by
   our use of `&&-let` chains and edition 2024) on Linux, macOS, and
   Windows.
3. Have at least one fuzz target if it parses untrusted input, with a
   nightly CI job exercising the corpus.
4. Have at least one criterion benchmark if it sits on a hot path.
5. Have a `README.md` that cites the relevant specification and
   declares the API stability stage.
6. Have a working `examples/` directory.
7. Reach 80%+ line coverage as measured by `cargo llvm-cov`, or
   document why a higher floor is unrealistic.

The `release.yml` workflow refuses to publish a crate that has not
passed all of the above.

## Open questions

- Whether to add a Cargo "alternative registry" mirror at our own
  domain so contributors behind restrictive networks can fetch builds
  without crates.io. Tracked separately.
- Whether to publish a workspace-level meta crate (`ferro-protocols`
  re-exports). Current plan: no — let consumers depend on the specific
  crate they need.
